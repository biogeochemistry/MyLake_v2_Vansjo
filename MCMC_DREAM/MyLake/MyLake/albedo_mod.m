function alb=albedo_mod(trans,sunalt,albedot1)

% ALBEDO: computes sea surface albedo following Payne (1972).
% alb=ALBEDO(trans,sunalt) computes the sea surface albedo from the
% atmospheric transmittance and sun altitude by linear interpolation 
% using Table 1 in Payne (1972), J. Atm. Sci., 29, 959-970. Assumes 
% trans and sunalt both matrices of same size. Table 1 is called 
% albedot1.mat.
%
% INPUT:   trans - atmospheric transmittance 
%          sunalt - sun altitude [deg] 
% 
% OUTPUT:  alb - albedo
