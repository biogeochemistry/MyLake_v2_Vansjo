Sept 23 2014 RMC
-Trying to recover what is going on in this folder
-Removing two useless script placing them in useless folder
-Renaming RMC_c_modelVAN_v12.m to MARS_storefj_MyL.m
-Observations in obs folders are .dat comma separeted. Creating an xls file to write these out conveniently. On hold.
-Copying MARS_storefj_MyL.m --> MARS_vanemfj_MyL.m and updating for Vanem
-Creating vanem_obs folder, c&p content of store_obs in it
-Running vanemfj ... crashed on NaNs at line 1141. Reactivated a few good lines I had written in Feb 2014. Runs but no model output.
-Using INCAP inputs for both, works fine. 
-simplifying input file names
-creating xls files for input and init and extending sims using YLI's data
-c&p weather from YLI 1983-1990, then using TSA weather. Will see that 
-I used the vanem INCA subcatchment as input for vanemfj. Will have to combine with store outflow at some point. 
-Unit conversion in INCA to Mylake: See notebook paper version 
- TP widely overestimated, but input file works with INCA from Reach 7 and flow from Reach 4 (otherwise not enough stuff)
- Both vanem and store works well with their own INCA inputs
- Migrating to Langtjern folder structure ... store and vanem ok
- extending parameter files to MyLake DOCOMO ... store and vanem ... 
- extending input file for DIC and O (Chla, DIC, DOC, O) ... store and vanem ok
-log off.
